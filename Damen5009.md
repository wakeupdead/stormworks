## Known flaws
Unfortunately Stormworks stairs are single size and makes it impossible making realistic designs so I had to experiment at some points. The other missing point is flexible windows so to keep original beauty of the vessel I had to get rid of windows in the wheelhouse. Maybe this will be fixed at some point...
