I'm proudly presenting new Damen 5009 SAR vessel developed using official Damen blueprints and scaled 1:1.
The boat is capable of doing SAR missions in various conditions.

- Deck crane for moving things around as well as winch
- Capable of hosting small SAR heli on deck (Boeing MH-1 by Xove with modified avionics and paint scheme is already there)
- Firefighting equipment includes two cannons and self-pprotecting devices
- Number of compartments is minimal to required only, this is reduce performance impact

### Specs
- Speed - up to 37 knots

- Fuel capacity - 100 t

### Systems
- Amazing MoBo by XLjedi with integrated sonar and radar
- Beacon locator
- Radio equipment

### Power
Vessel is powered with two Cat engines (multiengine devices) integrated into boat digital control system. Generators independenntly powered by two medium engines.

## Known flaws
Unfortunately Stormworks stairs are single size and makes it impossible making realistic designs so I had to experiment at some points. The other missing point is flexible windows so to keep original beauty of the vessel I had to get rid of windows in the wheelhouse. Maybe this will be fixed at some point...

Hope I mentioned every author however feel free to message me if not. The creation was inspired by many other authors and the community as well.

## Notes
Please do not reupload without my permission. However feel free to make your modifications of the vessel with mentioning original creation.

Creation was initially intended to host modular engines but I've decided to release this one earlier. So expecting to upgrade it further as well keep updating some other things.

Ping me if any comments, suggestions and finally ENJOY!
